## General Information
- We are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns.

## Technologies Used
- Python - Python 3.10.2</br>
- numpy - 1.21.5</br>
- seaborn - 0.11.2
- matplotlib - 3.4.3
- Pandas - 1.3.4</br>
- sklearn - 0.24.2</br>
- statsmodels - 0.12.2
